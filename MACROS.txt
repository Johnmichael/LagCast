There are two functions you may use for hooking into LagCast's spellcasting
internals.

The first function is
   LagCast(spellName): <no return value>
      spellName: the name of the spell. this is passed directly onto the
                 Blizzard API, therefore:
                   /script LagCast("Frostbolt") -- this will cast your maxrank frostbolt


There is a more detailed hook you can use, lets look at the source code for LagCast first:
  function LagCast(spellname)
    if LagCast_StopCasting(false) then
      CastSpellByName(spellname)
    end
  end


It's very simple, it centres on the function "LagCast_StopCasting", lets look at the spell
formally and see how we can use it in more complicated macros:

  LagCast_StopCasting(dryRun): returns boolean, whether spell
    dryRun: boolean, if true then SpellStopCasting() will not be called but the function
            will act as though it had been
    return value:
      Returns true if it's safe to cast a spell. If the cast bar is not shown this will
      return true regardless of whether you're not able to (spell locked, out of mana)
      
Usage:
  Lets say you had the following stopcasting macro: 
    /cast Nature's Swiftness
    /script SpellStopCasting()
    /cast Healing Touch
    
  To achieve the following while respecting the castbar, you can do this (it has to be a single line):
    /script if LagCast_StopCasting(true) then CastSpellByName("Nature's Swiftness"); SpellStopCasting(); LagCast("Healing Touch"); end
  
  If you're not doing instantcast magic (ones that involve Nature's Swiftness/Presence of Mind/etc), the
  following are completely equivalent:
    *) pressing your firebolt key
    *) /script LagCast("Firebolt")
    *) /script if LagCast_StopCasting(true) then LagCast("Firebolt") end
